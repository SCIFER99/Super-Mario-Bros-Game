# Super-Mario-Bros-Game
This is an attempt to recreate the 1985 version of Super Mario Bros!!! 

First, i must say how proud I am of myself! I love video games, especially after 
knowing I grew up playing them! Now, I am here developing them and love every 
bit of it! 

I took the liberty of developing the 1985 version of Super Mario Bros due to 
my nostalgia of it all! Me (and others) have dreamed of working 
at/with Nintendo! That is my goal! 

This is a substantial video game development program and guess what!? Did you 
know you can develop Super Mario in Python! Yes, you can! Here are the modules needed

    pip install os
    pip install sys
    pip install pytmx (in case you want to use 'Tiled' to develop the level)
    pip install pygame (of course)
    and all Python scripts used as modules! 

    Happy Coding!
